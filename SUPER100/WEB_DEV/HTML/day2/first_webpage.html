    <h1> ðŸ˜Ž <strong>My <u>FIRST</u> Webpage</strong> ðŸ˜Ž</h1>
    <p><hr>Welcome to my first webpage! This is a simple HTML document.<hr></p>
    <p>This page was created using <strong>HTML</strong> and guess what, its been just <strong><em>2 days</em></strong> (i.e. since 23<sup>rd</sup> july, 2024) since I've been learning <strong>HTML</strong>.</p> 
    <p>My name is <strong>jeshwanthshivasai </strong> and I am an <b><em>Architect</em></b> better yet I want to be a <b><em>Coder</em></b>, <br> before all this I was a human being and more specifically speaking a living being (cuz human beings die too). <br>As most of them I was made of <b>C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>31</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>13</sub>P<sub>2</sub></b>.</p>
    <hr><p>I'm <strong>SUPER EXCITED</strong> what all I can do as a <strong><em>FRONT-END DEV</em></strong>.</p><hr>
