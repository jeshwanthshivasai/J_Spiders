    --> return keyword returns the value to the code that called the function.
    --> it specifies that a specific value is supposed to return back to the caller or whether to print.
    --> it is also a control transfer statement which stops the program execution.

    --> currying is when a function takes a multiple arguments and executes them in multiple bits (i.e one big function into multiple functions) which will take one argument at a time. 
    --> it takes one argument and returns a new function that expects the new argument.

    --> pure functions do not have an internal state hence they depend on the arguments which we pass 
    --> we always get same results when paramters are passed
    --> impure functions produce different results whenever they are passed

    --> arguments will not be modified
    --> arguments may get modified
